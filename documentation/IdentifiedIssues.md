# MCP Messenger Technical Assessment Report - Updated Status (2025-03-29)

## Executive Summary

This technical assessment was conducted on the MCP Messenger server, a HIPAA-compliant WebSocket chat application. The review identified several issues ranging from critical security vulnerabilities to code quality concerns. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of each issue, explains its potential impact, and offers detailed solutions. **Status markers ([FIXED], [PARTIALLY FIXED], [NOT PRESENT], [VERIFIED]) indicate the current state after initial remediation efforts.**

## Critical Issues

### Issue #1: JWT Secret Hardcoded in Code [FIXED]

**Location**: `services/authService.js` (Original: Line 12)

**Description**: The JWT token secret is hardcoded in the source code as a fallback when not provided through environment variables.

```javascript
// Original Code
const TOKEN_SECRET = process.env.TOKEN_SECRET || 'your-secret-key-should-be-in-env-variables';
```

**Impact**: Critical security vulnerability allowing token forgery if the environment variable isn't set.

**Solution Applied**: Removed the hardcoded fallback. Added an explicit check for the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable, relying on `config.js` validation to prevent startup if missing.

### Issue #2: Insecure Password Storage in admin-config.json [FIXED]

**Location**: `dashboard/admin-config.json` (Original: Line 4)

**Description**: The admin dashboard configuration contained a hardcoded, unsalted SHA-256 password hash for the default admin user.

```json
// Original Code
"passwordHash": "240be518fabd2724ddb6f04eeb1da5967448d7e831c08c8fa822809f74c720a9"
```

**Impact**: Significant security risk due to weak hashing (SHA-256, no salt) and predictable default credentials.

**Solution Applied**: Removed the `passwordHash` line entirely from `dashboard/admin-config.json`. Admin credentials should be set via a secure initialization process.

### Issue #3: Weak Authentication in Admin Dashboard [FIXED]

**Location**: `dashboard/config.js` (Original: `hashPassword`, `verifyPassword` functions)

**Description**: The admin dashboard used unsalted SHA-256 hashing for password verification.

**Impact**: Vulnerable to brute-force attacks, potentially allowing unauthorized admin access.

**Solution Applied**: Modified `hashPassword`, `verifyPassword`, and `updatePassword` functions in `dashboard/config.js` to use Argon2id, consistent with the main application's user authentication. Added `require('argon2')`.

### Issue #4: Encryption Key Generation in Memory [FIXED]

**Location**: `services/encryptionService.js` (Original: `loadKeys` function fallback)

**Description**: The application generated temporary, non-persistent encryption keys in memory if proper keys (from environment variables or files) were not configured.

**Impact**: Critical vulnerability for HIPAA compliance. Restarting the app would regenerate keys, making previously encrypted data undecryptable (data loss).

**Solution Applied**: Removed the call to `generateTemporaryKeys()` as a fallback. The `loadKeys` function now throws a fatal error if persistent keys cannot be loaded, preventing the application from starting in an insecure state.

### Issue #5: Default Admin Credentials Displayed in Console [FIXED]

**Location**: `services/authService.js` (Original: around Line 398)

**Description**: When creating an initial admin account, the system printed the temporary password to the console logs.

**Impact**: Potential exposure of admin credentials if logs are captured or monitored insecurely.

**Solution Applied**: Removed the `console.log` line that displayed the temporary password. The log now only indicates that the account was created and requires a password change.

## Security Issues

### Issue #6: Insufficient Rate Limiting [FIXED]

**Location**: `api/middleware/rateLimit.js`

**Description**: The default rate limit (100 requests/15 min) was potentially too permissive for sensitive operations like authentication.

**Impact**: Increased risk of brute-force attacks and potential denial-of-service.

**Solution Applied**: Implemented separate rate limiters in `api/middleware/rateLimit.js`: a stricter `authLimiter` (10 requests/15 min) and a `standardLimiter` (100 requests/15 min). Updated `api/routes/index.js` to apply `authLimiter` to `/auth` routes and `standardLimiter` to other protected API routes.

### Issue #7: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Search Function [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `api/routes/userRoutes.js` (Original report location) / `services/userService.js` (Initial investigation finding)

**Description**: Report indicated unsafe SQL query construction for user search using string concatenation.

**Impact**: Potential for SQL injection attacks.

**Status**: Investigation revealed the user search functionality in `api/routes/userRoutes.js` already uses the `knex` query builder with parameterized queries, mitigating this risk. The vulnerable code snippet from the report was not found in the current implementation.

### Issue #8: WebSocket Messages Not Authenticated [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `websocket/broadcaster.js`

**Description**: Report indicated inconsistent permission checks before broadcasting messages via WebSockets.

**Impact**: Potential for users to send messages to channels they shouldn't access.

**Status**: Investigation revealed the `broadcastToChannel` method includes a check using `ChannelModel.isMember` to verify sender permissions before broadcasting. This appears to address the reported issue.

### Issue #9: Inadequate CSRF Protection [FIXED]

**Location**: `api/routes/index.js`, `admin/assets/*.js`

**Description**: Lack of CSRF token generation and validation for state-changing requests in the API and potentially the admin dashboard.

**Impact**: Vulnerability to CSRF attacks, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions.

**Solution Applied**: Installed `csurf` and `cookie-parser`. Added CSRF middleware (`csrfProtection`) using cookie storage to the main API router in `api/routes/index.js`. Frontend implementation in the admin dashboard (`admin/assets/*.js`) verified to correctly retrieve the token (via `getCsrfToken()`) and include it in state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) using the `CSRF-Token` header.
**Remaining Work**: None.

### Issue #10: Typo in Connection Count Update [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `websocket/broadcaster.js` (Original: Line 302 of snippet)

**Description**: Report indicated a typo (`sent: A0` instead of `sent: 0`) in broadcast results counting.

**Impact**: Incorrect metrics, potential runtime errors.

**Status**: Investigation confirmed the code correctly uses `sent: 0`. The comment in the original report snippet ("FIXED: This was previously A0") suggests it was corrected prior to this review.

### Issue #NPM: Low Severity Vulnerability in `cookie` package [ACKNOWLEDGED]

**Location**: `package-lock.json` (via `csurf` dependency)

**Description**: `npm audit` reports 2 low-severity vulnerabilities in `cookie` < 0.7.0, related to parsing cookie attributes with out-of-bounds characters.

**Impact**: Low risk in current server context. Potential for unexpected behavior if parsing malformed `Set-Cookie` headers from untrusted sources (not currently done).

**Status (2025-03-30)**: `npm audit fix` does not resolve the issue as the direct dependency (`csurf`) has not been updated. Acknowledging the low risk and deferring further action until `csurf` is updated or a higher-severity issue arises.

## Performance and Stability Issues

### Issue #11: Missing Database Connection Pooling Configuration [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `config/database.js`

**Description**: Report claimed lack of proper connection pool configuration (max connections, timeouts).

**Impact**: Potential connection leaks, poor performance under load.

**Status**: Investigation revealed `config/database.js` implements comprehensive connection pool configuration using values sourced from `config.js` (which includes defaults and environment variable overrides), including min/max connections, various timeouts, and event handling.

### Issue #12: Memory Leak in Session Management [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `dashboard/auth.js`

**Description**: Report claimed in-memory session storage (`activeSessions`) lacked cleanup mechanisms.

**Impact**: Potential for increasing memory usage and server crashes over time.

**Status**: Investigation revealed a `cleanupSessions` function exists and is called periodically via `setInterval` to remove expired and idle sessions from the `activeSessions` map, addressing the reported leak.

### Issue #13: Inefficient Message Broadcasting [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `websocket/broadcaster.js`

**Description**: Report claimed inefficient iteration (multiple times) through connections during broadcasts.

**Impact**: Potential high CPU usage and message delays with many users.

**Status**: Investigation showed the broadcast methods iterate through connections once to build recipient maps, avoiding duplicate sends and the reported multi-iteration inefficiency. While further optimization (e.g., `Promise.all`) might be possible, the core reported issue is not present.

### Issue #14: Lack of Proper Error Handling in WebSocket Connections [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: `chatServer.js`

**Description**: Report claimed inconsistent or missing error handling for WebSocket events and async operations.

**Impact**: Potential for unhandled promise rejections and server crashes.

**Status**: Investigation showed key asynchronous operations and event handlers (`handleWebSocketConnection`, `ws.on('message')`, `handleServerError`) are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks. While global `unhandledRejection` handling could further improve robustness, the specific reported lack of handling seems mostly addressed.

## Code Quality Issues

### Issue #15: Inconsistent Import Structure [NOT PRESENT]

**Location**: Multiple files

**Description**: Report claimed mixed use of CommonJS (`require`) and ES Modules (`import`).

**Impact**: Reduced maintainability and potential for subtle bugs.

**Status**: Investigation and search confirmed the codebase consistently uses CommonJS (`require`) syntax. The `fix-imports.js` script addresses relative path issues, not syntax mixing.

### Issue #16: Hardcoded Database Credentials [FIXED]

**Location**: `scripts/init-db.js`, `database/index.js`, `config.json`

**Description**: Database credentials hardcoded as fallback values if environment variables are not provided.

**Impact**: Security risk if deployed without proper environment configuration, potentially using weak default credentials (`admin123`).

**Solution Applied**: Removed hardcoded fallbacks from `scripts/init-db.js` and `database/index.js`. Added checks in `scripts/init-db.js` to ensure required environment variables are set before running. `config.js` already validates required variables for the main application run, but the default `admin123` was removed from `config.json` as well.

### Issue #17: Unsanitized User Input in HTML Generation [FIXED]

**Location**: `admin/assets/dashboard-messages.js`

**Description**: `message.id` used directly in `data-messageid` attributes without HTML escaping, creating a potential XSS risk.

**Impact**: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if message IDs could be manipulated to contain malicious content.

**Solution Applied**: Modified the HTML generation in `admin/assets/dashboard-messages.js` to apply `window.dashboard.escapeHtml()` to `message.id` values used in data attributes.


### Issue #18: Inadequate Logging and Monitoring [FIXED]

**Location**: Throughout the codebase

**Description**: Widespread use of `console.log` instead of a structured logging system.

**Impact**: Difficulty monitoring, troubleshooting, searching, and alerting based on logs in production.

**Solution Applied**: Installed `pino` and `pino-pretty`. Created a structured logger configuration (`config/logger.js`). Refactored codebase to replace `console.*` calls with appropriate `logger.*` calls. (Completed 2025-03-30)
**Remaining Work**: None.

## HIPAA Compliance Issues
### Issue #19: Insufficient PHI Handling [FIXED]

**Location**: `models/messageModel.js` (Message creation logic)

**Description**: Plaintext message content was stored in the `text` column if the `containsPHI` flag was false.

**Impact**: Potential storage of unencrypted PHI, violating HIPAA requirements if the flag is misused.

**Solution Applied**: Modified the message creation logic in `models/messageModel.js` to always store `NULL` in the plaintext `text` column, relying solely on the `encrypted_text` column.

### Issue #20: Weak Encryption Implementation [FIXED]

**Location**: `models/messageModel.js` (`encryptMessage`, `decryptMessage` functions)

**Description**: Used AES-CBC and stored a randomly generated key alongside the ciphertext in the database.

**Impact**: Critical vulnerability. If the database is compromised, encrypted data is easily decrypted, violating HIPAA.

**Solution Applied**: Rewrote `encryptMessage` and `decryptMessage` to use the centralized `EncryptionService` (which uses AES-GCM) and its persistently loaded keys (from environment variables). Encryption payload now stores IV, authTag, and encrypted data, but not the key itself.


### Issue #21: Audit Trail Deficiencies [PARTIALLY FIXED]

**Location**: `models/auditModel.js`

**Description**: Audit logging allowed optional batching for all events, lacked tamper-evidence mechanisms, and potentially missed required HIPAA fields.

**Impact**: Potentially incomplete or unreliable audit trails, hindering compliance and investigations.

**Solution Applied**: Modified `AuditModel.log` to identify critical events and log them immediately, bypassing batching. Enhanced logged details to include `hostname` and `processId`. Implemented basic tamper-evidence (hash chaining) for immediate logs (`writeLogImmediately`) and for logs written within database transactions (`logWithClient`) by adding `previous_log_hash` and `current_log_hash` columns and calculating hashes based on the previous log entry. (Completed 2025-03-30)
**Remaining Work**: Tamper-evidence (hash chaining) is not implemented for batched logs (`flushBatch`) due to complexity with bulk inserts. Further review and potentially add more specific HIPAA-related fields to the `details` object based on specific actions.
