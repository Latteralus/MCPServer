4. Begin comprehensive testing

## Long-term Roadmap
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced security features
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Scalability improvements

## Compliance Considerations
- Maintain HIPAA compliance throughout implementation
- Ensure comprehensive audit logging
- Implement robust access controls
- Secure data transmission and storage

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- WebSocket: ws
- Authentication: JWT-like token system
- Logging: Custom audit model
- Validation: express-validator

## Local Network Specifics
- Focus on secure, controlled environment
- Simplified authentication for local network
- Minimal external dependencies
- Performance-oriented design

## Post-Remediation TODOs (as of 2025-03-30)

Following an initial security remediation pass, the following tasks remain:

- [x] **Complete Structured Logging Refactor**: Replaced remaining `console.*` calls throughout the codebase with the structured `pino` logger (`config/logger.js`). (Completed 2025-03-30)
- [x] **Implement Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**: Enhanced `models/auditModel.js` to include cryptographic hashing/chaining for immediate logs. Batch/transactional logs excluded for now. (Completed 2025-03-30)
- [x] **Address Remaining NPM Vulnerability**: Investigated low-severity `cookie` vulnerability (via `csurf`). `npm audit fix` ineffective. Accepted risk for now, documented in `IdentifiedIssues.md`. (Assessed 2025-03-30)
- [ ] **Further Security Hardening**:
 - [ ] Implement a secure initialization process for the first admin user.
 - [ ] Implement or integrate a Key Management System (KMS) for encryption key rotation.
 - [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for the admin dashboard.
 - [ ] Configure and enforce HTTPS/WSS for all connections.
 - [ ] Review role permissions for least privilege.
 - [ ] Consider adding Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- [x] **Testing**: Initial Jest setup complete. Basic unit tests for RoleModel implemented. (Started 2025-03-30)
